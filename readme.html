<h1>Low NoSpam 3</h1>

<p>Low NoSpam 3 for ExpressionEngine removes third-party support, but offers a much better API for third-party developers to tap into. Other add-ons can use the Low NoSpam library for their own input.</p>

<h2>Extension Settings</h2>

<p>Extension Settings are mostly the same: choose a service, enter an API key (which will be validated upon save), and choose which of the native actions you want the Low NoSpam service to check.</p>

<h2>Low NoSpam Library</h2>

<p>The Low NoSpam Library will be loaded on Sessions Start, so it will be available throughout EE using <code>$this->EE->low_nospam</code>. The library stores an internal data array with data to send to the NoSpam service. Available methods:</p>

<h3>get_services()</h3>
<p>A nested array of available services. Currently Akismet and TypePad AntiSpam.</p>

<h3>set_service($name, $key)</h3>
<p>Tells the library which service to use, with which API key. Possible values for <code>$name</code> are the keys given in <code>get_services</code>.</p>

<h3>key_is_valid()</h3>
<p>Returns <code>TRUE</code> if the set API is valid.</p>

<h3>get_service()</h3>
<p>Currently selected service (array).</p>

<h3>get_service_name()</h3>
<p>Currently selected service short name (string).</p>

<h3>set_member_groups($ids)</h3>
<p>Used to set member group IDs that were set by the user in the Extension Settings.</p>

<h3>get_member_groups()</h3>
<p>Returns the member group IDs set by <code>set_member_groups($ids)</code>.</p>

<h3>is_available()</h3>
<p>Returns <code>TRUE</code> if the service is available, <code>FALSE</code> if not.</p>

<h3>set_data($key, $value = FALSE)</h3>
<p>Either sets a single value in the internal data array or (if <code>$key</code> is an array) merges an entire array with the internal data array.</p>

<h3>set_content_by_post($ignore = array())</h3>
<p>Sets the content key of the internal data array to the contents in <code>$_POST</code>, ignoring the keys given in <code>$ignore</code>.</p>
